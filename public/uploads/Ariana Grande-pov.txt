It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You've got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass the way you see through me

You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty
And all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever
Loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I'm getting used to receiving
Still getting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared
Learning to be grateful for myself

You love my lips, 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it starting to subside
Learning to believe in what is mine

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty
And all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever
Loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I couldn't believe it
Or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now, I'm out here falling, falling
Frozen, slowly thawing
Got me right
I won't keep you waiting, waiting
All my baggage fading safely
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty
And all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view

I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me, baby (Trust me)
'Cause nobody ever
Loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
Yeah
