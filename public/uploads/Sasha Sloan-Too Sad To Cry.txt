Wasn't raised religious
But I wish that I was
Having nothing to believe in
Has been killing my buzz

Yeah, I cut my hair
Close the blinds
Play Hallelujah like two dozen times
And yesterday I tried to pray
But I didn't know what to say

I'm too sad to cry
Too high to get up
Don't even try 'cause I'm scared to fuck up
Don't like to talk
Just lay in my bed
Don't even try to go out with my friends
Lied to my doctor
She knew I was faking
Gave me some pills but I'm too scared to take 'em
I try and I try
But I'm too sad to cry

Can't tell my mama
It makes her worry
I'm not suicidal
But sometimes the lines get all blurry

Yeah, I cut my hair
Closed the blinds
Played Hallelujah like two dozen times
And yesterday I tried to pray
But I didn't know what to say

I'm too sad to cry
Too high to get up
Don't even try 'cause I'm scared to fuck up
Don't like to talk
Just lay in my bed
Don't even try to go out with my friends
I lied to my doctor
She knew I was faking
Gave me some pills but I'm too scared to take 'em
I try and I try
But I'm too sad to cry

I'm too sad to cry
Too high to get up
Don't even try 'cause I'm scared to fuck up
Don't like to talk
Just stay in my bed
Don't even try to go out with my friends
Lied to my doctor
She knew I was faking
Gave me some pills but I'm too scared to take 'em
I try and I try
But I'm too sad to cry
