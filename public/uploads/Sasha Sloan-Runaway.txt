Strung out in the back of a black car
No keys, all I got is my credit cards
And I've been here a million times
Drive fast with The Beatles in the background
Till 'em take the 101 out of this town
I was never one to say goodbye

Every time I fall in love
I go and fuck it up right when it gets good
Don't you think it's funny
Don't you think it's funny
And I know I did all the shitty things to you
I said I never ever would
Baby, that's so like me
Yeah baby, that's so like me

I don't know why I always run away
I don't know why I always run away
What we had was special
I know what we had was special
Don't know why I always run away
I don't know why I always run away
What we had was special
I know what we had was special

Strung out in the back of a black car
I've got a little too good at breaking hearts
I wonder if I'll ever stop

Every time I fall in love
I go and fuck it up right when it gets good
Don't you think it's funny
Don't you think it's funny
And I know I did all the shitty things to you
That I said I never ever would
But baby, that's so like me
Yeah baby, that's so like me

I don't know why I always run away
I don't know why I always run away
What we had was special
I know what we had was special
I don't know why I always run away
I don't know why I always run away
What we had was special
I know what we had was special
What we had was special

I don't know why I always run away
I don't know why I always run away
What we had was special
I know what we had was special
I don't know why I always run away
I don't know why I always run away
What we had was special
I know what we had was special

Strung out in the back of a black car
I've got a little too good at breaking hearts
I was never one to say goodbye
